## Reporting a Vulnerability
We use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** to handle security issues.

### How to report:
1. Navigate to the [Security tab]() of this repository.
2. Under "Reporting", click **Advisories**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.

This opens a private form where you can provide the Title, Description (Summary, Details, PoC, Impact), and Severity details. This report will only be viewable by repository maintainers.
